# Contest-Problems

This repository contains a collection of programming problems, each identified by a unique prefix that signifies the source page and the problem number. The problems are sourced from various platforms, including contest competitions and random selections. <br/> <br/> 
Feel free to explore my solutions! All codes in this repository were accepted for their respective problems.

## Naming Convention 

- CF: [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/)
- UVA: [OnlineJudge](https://onlinejudge.org/)
- For problems associated with a specific contest, the file name includes a label indicating the contest, such as `CF-Round913`
- Random problems not tied to a particular contest are labeled with the source page number, like `UVA-318`

> [!NOTE]
> Generally, problems from UVA are selected from the book [Competitive Programming by Steven Halim and Felix Halim](https://cpbook.net/), while problems from CodeForces are contest problems.
